# Bought a Thinkpad X220 on Ebay

![thinkpad-x220](/assets/thinkpad-x220.jpg)

I've worked on a Thinkpad T-series a few years after graduating from the University.  I was side-hustling as a freelance web developer working on websites that dealt mostly with PHP and Java Servlets.  I loved working on that Thinkpad.  It was reliable and didn't get in my way. I felt I could get in the zone a lot quicker back then.  (Or maybe it was because I didn't have four daughters interrupting me at home like I do now).

Ever since then, I've been a long time lurker of [r/thinkpad](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/) for the longest time.  I'd look at the images members would post on the site and reminisce abou the good times I've had with my past thinkpad and wonder when I would get another one.

The computers provided to me at work have ranged from Dells notebooks and Macbooks.  They've been ok and when I got a Macbook for work, I thought I was in heaven. Up until recently, when I received a Macbook with those crappy keyboards.  Oohh, how I hate that keyboard.

The crappy keyboard, the lack of ports that I have to carry a dongle everywhere, the new usb-c port.  All of these finally led me to go to ebay and buy a 20 year old Thinkpad X220 for $90.
