Improve Product Innovation and Quality
======================================

- Forum  with other Eclipse GUI Devs within CA to how they do their workflow
    * skimmed over the Eclipse User Interface Standards MFNE Documentation (focused User Interface)
    * I'm interested in SDLC, would like that to be part of the topic as well.
- Decide on Testing framework for all GUI devs
    * Automated Testing with Continous Build
        - Maven / Tycho / Jenkins
        - need assistance in setting this up
    * TDD
        + add test cases as we go and have automated testing (eliminates breaking code issue)
    * Decide on GUI Testing Framework
        + Junit / Jubula / SWTBot
- Pair Programming
    * Ilidio and I were pair programming during Beta and Regression Testing
    * we both found it a positive experience
- Eclipse JRebel Plugin
    * over the last 174 days JRebel has prevented at least 3058 redeploys/restarts savying me about 51 hours.
- RTC seems a better choice than what we currently use in FileMasterPlus
    * we have company support
        + have emailed Lindi Gricius (saw a RTC demo video from her), and she is directing me to other resource that can assist
        + other teams are using it, can ask them for help (Chorus/Emri)
    * RTC has code reviews built in
        + http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9512830/how-to-review-code-that-was-submitted-to-me-in-rtc-with-submit-for-review-feat
    * RTC SCM has a better way of managing multiple streams than Harvest, I believe
        + https://jazz.net/library/article/41
    * maybe we should transition to RTC for FileMaster IMS? 



Hi Aline,

After yesterday’s meeting and speaking with Scott, wehhito revive 
the forum for Eclipse developers to discuss Best practices for Eclipse Development.  


- Eclipse GUI Testing Framework 
    + SWTBot / Jubula / JUnit
- How to set up Automated Testing and Continuous Integration
    + Maven / Tycho / Jenkins
    + TDD Mindset

- Code Review
    + (Gerrit / RT)
- Pair Programming Experiences
- SCM
    + RTC vs Harvest)-  JRebel Plugi

Anyways, if you can let me know who would be interested in such a forumno
