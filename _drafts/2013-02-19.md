* MaryNa's issue - Resolved
	java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Index out of bounds
	at com.ca.filemaster.editor.virtualtableviews.CharacterDataEditingSupport.getCellEditor(CharacterDataEditingSupport.java:294)
* Defect 1742
	It works better - no error appears, but still not usable for real hex edit:
	- In the beginning  I can see all 3 lines, ok so far.
	- When I try to edit a character the hex part disappears
	- When I press down arrow, all 3 lines disappear
	see the attached           HEX  for SEQ file.doc
* Attended CA Testing Tools Global User Webcast
