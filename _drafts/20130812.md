* working on multirecord overtyping story using large number of columns
	- use datasets from mahi and robert
	- working with Ilidio and Richa regard NPE error I'm getting
	- tableViewer.getTable.getColumn <- only has two columns availabe and
	  I'm accessing 312.
	- sent an email to Ravish about this.  Hopefully he can fix it soon.
* working on CharFormatMode now
	- Refactored EditingSupportFileMaster and child classes
	- code has been refactored.. doing testing on this now.
* working also on Numeric field overtype
	- when it's a numeric field, the rules are different
	- can't work on this b/c of the tableViewer.getTable().getColumn issue
