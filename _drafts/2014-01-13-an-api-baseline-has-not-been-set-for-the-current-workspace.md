I created a new E4 project and I get this error in the in Problem View:

![Problem View](/img/problem-view-an-api-baseline-has-not-been-set-for-the-current-workspace.png)

It's ok to ignore this issue for now:

* Windows > Preferences > Plug-in Development > API Baselines > Options > Missing API baseline
* Change to "Ignore" int he pull-down list.
