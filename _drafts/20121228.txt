* Look at the list and see what needs to be done in the find dialog.
* Richa told me to look into 1425

GUI - find occurrence FIRST, NEXT, LAST, FIND !
to reproduce 
open file ad1qa.fmmvs90.test.fruz in edit mode
1) do a FIND dialog string=Ness , occurrence = next(=default), location=Prefix , and press FINDALL button
3 matches found
positioning?
highlight ?

EC: It went to line 8522 and highlighted two instances of Ness in the same line.
8640 highlighted in green as well.  Had to scroll down to find it.
The highlighting is there and it positioned it to 8522 properly.

2) do a FIND dialog string=Ness, occurrence=first , location=prefix and press FIND button
line 8522 blue background and first string Ness in green 

EC: Confirmed 

3) do a FIND dialog string=Ness, occurrence=next , location=prefix and press FIND button
same line 8522 blue background and first string Ness in green (NOK !)

EC: this is now working.  it still stays on line 8522 but this time it highlights the second instance of 
Ness in the same sentence.

4) do a FIND dialog string=Ness, occurrence=next , location=prefix and press FIND button
same line 8522 blue background and nextt string Ness in green 

EC: Ok this part is not working.. need to fix this issue.

same line 8522 blue background andt string Ness in green(=NOK!)
