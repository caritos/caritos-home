* for 1518, test on the QA server.  Work with Ken and Richa on this issue.
* does it matter CharFormatMode - 
	- cell table, identify the class.
* Overtyping
	- error messages for overtyping should be displayed to the user
	- we send to the mainframe when we lose focus
	- it you modify the hex and the char is below 40 it is inthe protected list.
	- variable block file can change the length
	- one to one to substition
	- record length should be the same.
	- when you delete,the string is padded with blank character
	- pasting needs to be supported, but there are rules for pasting..in the meeting , it went to the second position.
	- protected ranges can be modified in hexidecimal representation.
	- under 40 in hex is protected
* Make sure all the other find issues are closed.
	- last week, I worked on 1422,1508,1518
	- looking into 1522, 1511, 
* 1511
	If you use the findlimit to limit a search, return to the top of the file and issue the same search with a different limt, the new limit is not honored.
	Steps to reproduce the problem:
	1. Open the file AD1QA.FMMVS90.TEST.FRUY in edit or view mode.
	2. RIght-click in the file and select Find\Change.  the Find\Change dialog box will open.
	3. Enter Ness in the Find control.
	4. Change the Find Limit to 1815.
	5. Click Find.
	Notice:  The find will work.
	6.  Go to the top of the file by either using the Locate dialog to go to the first line or by scrolling to the top and clicking on the first record.
	7. Change the FInd Limit to 1813.
	8. Click Next
	Notice:  The find goes to record 1815 even though it is now beyond the limit.
* 1522
	open file ad1qa.fmmvs90.test.fruz in edit mode
	2)do a FIND string=Ness,  location=prefix  occurrence=previous  and press FIND Button 
	you see message CAWA447I message (NOK ?)
	3) press ok 
	you see message string not found and nothing is highlighted any more (=OK)
	4)do a FIND string=Ness,  location=prefix  occurrence=next and press FIND Button
	second Ness is highlighted 
	It should be the first string !
	Also a  problem occus when i do 
	1)do a FIND string=Ness,  location=prefix  occurrence=last and press FIND Button
	2)do a FIND string=Ness,  location=prefix  occurrence=next  and press FIND Button 
	you see message string not found and nothing is highlighted any more (=OK)
	3)do a FIND string=Ness,  location=prefix  occurrence=previous  and press FIND Button
	you will see the second occurrence in line 8522 . This is wrong !
* Need to focus on the priority
	- overtyping issue
		+ charmode and single record mode
		+ protected modes are highlighted in grey
		+ tableViewerColumn.setEditingSupport(new DataCharEditingSupport(this, viewer, tableViewerColumn.getViewer())); 
		+ VerifyListener is too specific
	- multiple editors
	- defects

* do a "replacement" for the editorWidget // replacement as defaultThis document specifies the behavior of the Record when on Edit Mode.
* Rules of DataCharTextCellEditor:
	Insert  / Delete / Copy / Paste /arenot supportedin this story
	Pasting with more then X characters
	Always in insert mode.
	How to get in insert mode.
	Single Record :
	The Value column is the onlycolumn that can be changed.
	The cust-id record can not be written.
	If the layout is incorrect, and thevalue overlaps the fiedld
	In single record, thelength for each record is not important?
	Even in hex mode, still the whole field is protected.
	Overwrites the whole field
	Insert mode needs tto be supported.
	Is this fixed width
* sent an email to the group about what should be done with overtyping.
