# Improving at Chess in the 40s

![Screen Shot 2020-11-16 at 6.09.44 AM](/assets/2020-11-16-improving-at-chess-in-the-40s/Screen%20Shot%202020-11-16%20at%206.09.44%20AM.png)

My interest in Chess has increased during the pandemic.  I've been playing with friends and at [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/).  I'd like to improve.

## Where I am

I'm going to focus my attention on Blitz games (3+0 games) for I think it is just the right amount of time to play with other people during my breaks.  At lichess.org, my rating it 1088. I'd like to improve it so that I'm at least better than 50% of the people playing. 

If you want to play chess with me, you can find me at lichens.org as [sotirac](https://lichess.org/@/sotirac).  

## How to get better

Like all things, it takes effort and time.

I've got to start reviewing the games that I play and figuring out my mistakes.

Another thing I can do is to do a bunch of chess puzzles to quickly recognize opportunities.

The other thing is reading and learning about opening theories and positional concepts.
