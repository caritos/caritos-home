title: Why Migrate to Eclipse 4
categories: eclipse
---

* One importatnt technical reason to migrate to the Eclipse 4.x API is that it provides a consistent and well-designed API.  The concept of the application model and dependency injection makes your application code concise and flexible.  Services and the renderer toolkit can be replaced, which adds more flexibility to your implementation.

* The event service and the extensible Eclipse context hierarchy provide very powerful ways to communicate within your application.

* The Eclipse 3.x API is effectively frozen.  In addition to the technical advantages the focus of development is concentrated ont he Eclipse 4.x API.  New features will only be available for Eclipse 4 implementations.

* Adds more flexibility and makes components easier to re-use and test.  The basic idea is to separate worbench specifi parts from parts that can POJOs.
