Obitalk Review
==============

I cancelled my home phone account with Verizon about 8 years ago (a year before my marriage) and have been using VOIP as my primary home phone number ever since then.
Skype has been my de-facto voip provide since I cut the tether with Verizon.  Skype has been pretty good because of it's price (about $30/year) to have an inbound and outbound number.
The major disadvantage is that their phones suck.  
I've used the Linksys Iphone CIT4000(http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/05/linksys-cit-400-a-skype-phone-without-os-limits/) and theIPEVO S0-20 Wi-Fi Skype Phone (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuAYdoymF0w).
I wanted a skype phone where I didn't want it attached to a running computer. Both were pretty expensive as they cost about ~$150 individually.  The interface to the phone sucked as well.  It was pretty clumsy have to use the numeric keypad to enter your skypeusername and password.
I've since switched to Obitalk VOIP service (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B004LO098O/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004LO098O&linkCode=am2&tag=eladcari-20">OBi100 VoIP Telephone Adapter and Voice Service Bridge</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eladcari-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B004LO098O" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
) and don't see myself going back.  The service is free and it piggybacks off Google Voice.
Plus, I can just use a regular phone.  I bought a Uniden Phone <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B007ORP2S2/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B007ORP2S2&linkCode=am2&tag=eladcari-20">D1780-4 DECT 6.0 Expandable Cordless Phone with Digital Answering System, Silver, 4 Handsets</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eladcari-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B007ORP2S2" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

I've been using Google Voice service for my business so that my transition was pretty easy.

The installation is pretty easy.. You just buy the Obi100VoiP Telephone Adapter and hook that up to your home network router.  You then connect your normal phone to the Obi100Voip Telephone Number. (should I add pictures here).
Youthen go to Obitalks website toconfigure the device with Google Voice.  This waspretty easy.  If you needsome assistance, just call me and I can help you out.

Also, Google Voice provides free calls to US and Canada for free. So that's a plus.

I've been using this setup for a month now with no issues at all.  My wife who is a technophone loves that fact that she is using a regular phone.


Notes: Maybe there should be a plug that I am going to earn money if they click on the link.
