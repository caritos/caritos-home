* working from home b/c I have to pick up the kids of playgroups.
* doing research, have to figure out what problems can occur when we go to E4, 
  so far I haven't done that yet.
* look into which tools to use for screen recording.  going to be a tips and tricks 
  video about FMP v9.0.
* updating my notes directory.
	- need to spruce up my notes
* inspired by Audrey Roy to be more productive.
* borrowed all this Maximum PC from the library, been craving about creating a gaming rig with multiple monitors.
  But I don't really need it.. The size of my iMac is pretty sufficient to do most if not all things.
  It's just another excuse for me not to work seriously. Returning back to the library asap.  Don't 
  need another distraction.  Whatever PC I have should be sufficient.
* need to focus on eclipse/java development.. That is my forte and should be my niche.
* updated my font for eclipse to use source code pro
* testing branches/git through eclipse.
