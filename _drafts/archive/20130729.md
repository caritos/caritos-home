* 2292 - Work in Progress
AD1QA.FMMVS90.KSDS.KEYCELL1.LRECL12K
with 
AD1QA.FMMVS90.LONG.RECORD.PDS(CKK12A)

I’m going to mimic mainframe’s behavior regarding the left and right arrow keys to an extent.
When editing a FileMasterRecordField, when the user presses the right arrow key, the cursor position will move 1 character to the right.  On the last visible character presented, if the user presses the right arrow key again, it will stay at that current position. (On Mainframe, when you keep pressing  the right arrow key, cursor position goes to the next record).
When editing a FileMasterRecordField, when the user presses the left arrow key, the cursor position will move 1 character to the left.  The cursor position will go up to the left most visible character.  If the line number records are visible, the left arrow key will not be able traverse that portion of the data. (On Mainframe, when you keep pressing the left arrow key, cursor position goes to the previous record)

See attached images.  The red marks is where the right and left arrow key can function.

	- fixed
* traversal keys
	- up arrow
	- down arrow
	- left arrow
	- right arrow

20130802

* worked on traversal, left and right arrow keys
* worked on protected modes, when overtyping, it doesn't overtype the protected modes

20130805
========

* let's work on the other operations

* thinking about working on Character Mode First
	- Single Record Mode
	- Multi Record last
* overtyping in the first column works. 
	- overtyping in the last column does not work yet.  Waiting on Ravish to implement that.

* last record field still deals with all the data not just what is visibile.
	- ravish has to fix this.
* when editing all data (including hexdata) it looks ugly.
* need assistance when resizing the column (make it smaller), have hexdata on.  displaying the fields wraps incorrectly.
  b/c of the added Constants.LINE_SEPARATOR.
  	- asked Ilidio to help me out on this.
* Overtying in MRM is almost done.. Asking Robert for some pre-QA.
	- working on the bugs he submitted.
* Working on Character Mode.
