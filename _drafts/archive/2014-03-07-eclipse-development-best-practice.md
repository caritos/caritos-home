News:
-   Did you guys watch/hear Michael Maggio’s Worldwide Application Development Business Line Strategy Worldwide Town Hall.  If not, here is the link: http://webcasts.ca.com/mediasite/Viewer/?peid=b2a44c16f476434e8f5a9015460bb8511d.  It seems to me that the “Application Workbench” uses the Eclipse Plugin Architecture to mesh a lot of products together.   Let me know if people are interested in discussing the “Application Workbench” further.  As the people who develop and maintain these Eclipse products, we can provide a lot of input on how to make the different CA Eclipse products more seamless/integrated.
-   EclipseCon 2014 (https://www.eclipsecon.org/na2014) in San Francisco starts on March 17.  I’ll be attending the conference.  The list of sessions for EclipseCon can be found here https://www.eclipsecon.org/na2014/eclipsecon/schedule/session/2014-03-17.  If you are interested in any of these topics, I can attend the session, take notes, and provide it to you.  Let me know and I’ll do my best to attend.  Email me at eladio.caritos@ca.com and let me know which session you want me to attend.
-   Email me if you have any topics that you would like to discuss, we will include it in the “Suggested Topic” session.  If you would like to present on any of these topics, let’s set it up.  I know, I would really love someone to present on how they use SCM for their development (how best to use package context/code reviews/merging with different streams).

Suggested Topics for Future Discussion:
-   Possible use of Java 7 for new Development
-   Migrating from Tomcat to JBOSS
-   Javadocs comments in code
-   Automated Testing and Continuous Builds
-   Pair Programming Experience
-   Development tools to increase productivity
-   SCM practice
-   Code Review Workflow
