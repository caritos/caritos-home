	- this is not an overtyping issue 
	- need to disable find/change/located context menu items.
	- This defect does not deal with Overtyping.
	  We need to disable the context menu items “Find/Change” and “Locate” 
	  When there is an error in the modified values.
	  Mahi did similar work in this territory where she disabled the  “previous” / “next” button if there was error in the data.
	  We need to reuse that code snippet to also display the context menu items.
	  Assigning this defect to Richa
