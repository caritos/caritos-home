Personal
--------

* try to eat healthier
* I have some polvoron and mamon in the closet.  Do not eat it now.  See how long you can wait to eat it.
* Dress in semi-formal clothes 5 days a week.  Just be consistent about this.  1st impression makes a difference and your dress/appearance matters.
* When at home or at the mall, where the calhart pants and stuff.
* don't work on side projects at work.  
* Today is Thursday.  I'm glad the week is gong fast.  At home, I sleep at around 8pm but I wake up at 12am.  I then go back to sleep at 4am and sleep till 6am.
* Would like to get the crib converted to just a regular bed.. Wondering if Sophia would like to sleep in that bed.. That crip is about 4 years old now.  That's pretty good.  We didn't spend that much money on the babies.  All girls so they can get the same stuff.
* Bought a new lens this morning.. The current lens that I have is just too hard too focus on.. We need to have everybody on the picture.. The lens cost me around $600 dollars.  I used it as abusiness expense.
* My hobbies are photography and sports and technology.
	- I'll take photos during our hikes
	- I play bball, tennis, ping pong, and rb to get some exercise.
	- No need to do P90X when I can get it done in the afternoons.
	- Would like to go hiking though.
* And I have three kids to play with.  Keeps me very busy.
* Start playing bball in the morning.  And go to the fitness class in the afternoon.  This should help me lose some weight quickly.
* learn more about photography.  Read some books.
* maybe it's a good time to take the kids to the library today.  I got some books to pick up in the library.  
* Maybe I should get fitbit.  or use my fitness watch to monitor my heart rate. Need to be really fit and scientific about this whole thing.
* I am going to check out the library and see if the 4 hour body is available. Figure out what nutrients I need to improve my system.  Be rigorous and scientific. Eat a lot of fish but I tend to add a lot of salt.
* Got to work on my diet.
	- no more patis for my meals.  No need to add extra salt to my plate.
	- try to limit the white rice that we eat.  Eat more whole grain rice.
	- Is basmati rice heathier than white rice? Make the change.
* I want my kids to be healthy as well.
	- buy some tofu and fry it up (isn't that not healthy, frying it up)
* If I tend to eat a lot, I should exercise more.  One month of exercising everyday, 5 days a week should help me lose weight.  This month, I weighed 201. I just need a regular scale.. No need to get fancy.  Just take a photo of it everytime you are on the scale so that I can decipher.  I can then track my fitness level.
