Hi, my name is Eladio Caritos, one of the developers tasked to build an Eclipse 
RCP/Plugin for the File Master Plus IMS product.  This "distribution list" 
which you are currently subscribed to has been created to foster communication 
between Eclipse developers.  Hopefully by sharing our workflow/practices with 
each other, we can make it easier to develop Eclipse products as well as improve 
it's quality.

Some topics up for discussion are:

- Make File Master Eclipse GUI use the same type Tomcat server setup that 
  Symdumps and MAT uses
- Migrating from Tomcat to JBOSS
- Javadoc comments in code
- Pros and cons of migrating to Eclipse 4.x APIs
- Which GUI testing framework to use (Junit/SWT-BOT/Jubula)
- Automated testing and continuous builds
    * Maven / Tycho / Jenkins
    * Environment Setup
- Pair programming experience
- Tools to improve software efficiency such as JRebel Plugin
- SCM practices 
    - Harvest vs. RTC
    - how to manage multiple streams
- Working with the WIX toolset/InstallShield
- Code review workflow

There is no format to this distribution list, if anybody would like to start
a conversation, just reply to all.
