Defect 2134
-----------
I installed the 2013-03028 build on my machine and after a few tries I was able to replicate it.
I looked at the error logs and this is what I found

java.lang.NullPointerException
at org.eclipse.jface.viewers.OwnerDrawLabelProvider$OwnerDrawListener.handleEvent(OwnerDrawLabelProvider.java:48)
at org.eclipse.jface.window.Window.open(Window.java:801)
at com.ca.filemaster.editor.handlers.FindCommandHandler$1.run(FindCommandHandler.java:150)
