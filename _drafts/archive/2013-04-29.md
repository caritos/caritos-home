* we are looking for what happens with change
	change 
	JACK -- ZZZZ
	the first instance of jack is replaced to zzzz
	the key number column is not changed.
	the rest of the instance of jack is highlighted in green
	this is happening in both cases so this is correct behavior.
	
	change all
	
	my version
	the first instance of jack has been replaced by zzzz. in fact all instance have been replaced by zzzz
	the line numbers are blank
	there are no green highlights.
	
	beta version
	all instance of "jack" has been replaced by "zzzz"
	in the places where it has been replaced, the line number column has been highlighted in yellow with the word "==CHG>"
	this should be the right version

* leave it as it "find current"
* wrapping to first position or last position,  should not wrap.. 
* send out a build to Guy for testing.

Single Record Mode
Hightlight something but still figure out if it's the whole field since the MF response does not give us a range.. just the start position.
fieldName is never is being used.. leave it empty.

* played bball and i'm not huffing and puffing as much
* guy and patrice sent their findings.  will look it over and provide a new build for them 
	+ Find ‘0123456789’ next -> scrolls to record 76 It seems that defect 2138 (FIND positions the line with the match as the last visible line on the screen when doing FIND .. NEXT) isn’t addressed. 
	+ FIND any packed field isn’t possible anymore because the “Find” and “Find All” buttons are greyed out when the FIND string field is empty; the button should be enabled when find Type is Packed Decimal and a length (1-32) is filled in. In fact, even when the find string is filled in, the buttons remain greyed out
	+ FIND of a hexadecimal string isn’t possible anymore because the “Find” and “Find All” buttons are greyed out
	+ FIND case sensitive gives an error if the length of the string >16.  This is wrong. The error doesn't go away even when the length of the string becomes less than 16 The error also appears in "Char" when using "down arrow" to scroll through the remembered strings on the string AFTER a "long" string
	+ FIND ALL doesn't show the number of matches (Found found times). This seems to happen only when the string to find contains an embedded blank.  E.g. FIND ‘3 a’ ALL
	+
