This video will demonstrate the 3 ways of opening up a dataset in the GUI version of File Master Plus Version Nine Point O.
The first way is to select the dataset in the directory list window by left clicking on it.  Right click to bring up its context menu. Scroll down to select the "Open" menu item.  This brings up the "Open Data Set" window.
Press the finish button.
The second way to open up a dataset is to once again left click on the dataset found in the directory list window, now just press F3.  This brings up once again the "Open Data Set" window, Press the finish button.
The third way to open up a dataset is to left click not on the dataset but the server that is associated with that dataset.  Go to "CA File Master PLus" menu and select open.  This brings up the "Open Data Set" window.  
You can either manually type in the dataset you want to open or better yet, use the drop down menu to select a recently opened dataset. Click Next. And then Finish.
And that concludes our demo regarding multiple ways of opening up a dataset.
Thank you for watching.
