Java Development with Eclipse is getting real old for me.
I'm trying IntelliJ IDEA for a month to see if it makes me a more efficient programmer.
One thing I really like in the beginning is to toggle the project view.  The keyboard shortcut of COMMAND+1 allows
me to hide the project view very quickly.  I like that.  It reminds me of NERDTree's Toggle View.
I'm using version 10 so it's got GitHub integration which is pretty nifty.  This will likely push me to use GitHub rather
than Bitbucket.
Another cool thing about is that they have a free plugin that allows you to use VI as your editor.  Very very cool.
