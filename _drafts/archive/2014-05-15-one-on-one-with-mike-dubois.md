    - provide initial summary
    - provide ppt summary
    - when is the next factory meeting (just need to nail down the date)

    - getting more complicated since we are discussing internal implementation
      (threads / new session id / waiting for the response everytime for both
       scenarios)
        * little bit worried that the story might be too large
          and might not be able to finish
    - research task is almost complete..
    - started task to create the archive dialog box.
* agile methodology (improve product innovation and quality)
    - i still think we could get better at creating stories and making it more smaller.
      during the stories, maybe we should discuss implementation details further.
      that way it get's a better sized.  Usually, the response is "that's implementation
      we can worry about that later".
    - US team members are great.  I'm communicating with Guy and Kip for the backend.
      People in Islandia (Ravish / Richa / Mahi) we are always talking.
    - i like the format of the status meetings, where we discuss based on stories
      rather than by people (story based rather then people based)
    - ordered/got the book "Succeeding with Agile", will read it when i need a break
    - i think we should have code review sessions with the team from prague as well as here
      currently we don't have any practice in place.

      nobody has really asked for help yet.
