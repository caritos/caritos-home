* PREV issue for FIND
	- sent to Patrice for investigation
	- submitted thourough log to him.
* Need to get instructions on how to start the tomcat servers 
	- got assistance from Ilidio. Saved the transcript from IM log, check outlook if you need to refresh
* Getting this exception still:
	!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 0 2013-01-07 04:13:45.878
	!MESSAGE Unhandled event loop exception
	!STACK 0
	java.lang.ClassCastException: com.ca.filemaster.common.FileMasterDataset cannot be cast to com.ca.filemaster.common.FMPVSAMDataset
		at com.ca.filemaster.editor.virtualtableviews.CharFormatMode$2.getValue(CharFormatMode.java:280)
	- being resolved by Ravish
	- I checked in the code and update the issue tracker to say that it has been fixed.
* The only issue with get/find prev/next is highlighting in blue.
	- spent too long trying to figure this out.
	- richa commented that I fixed the code pretty well.  I had fixed other errors as well not associated with the issue that I was fixing.
	- get this resolved and move on.
	- everything works except the highlight in blue issue.
* ideas for hilight in blue
	// with everything
	public void setHighlight(int lineNumber,int rangeIndex) {
		tableViewer.refresh();
		hitNumber = lineNumber;
		hitIndex = rangeIndex; // have to specify the rangeIndex so that EditLabelProvider knows how to highlight in green
		FindChangePrimaryCommandWizardPage.ACTIVE_RECORD_NUMBER = lineNumber;
		tableViewer.getTable().setSelection(hitNumber - 1); // table is zero-index based
		tableViewer.getTable().setTopIndex(hitNumber - 1); // table is zero-index based
	}
	
	// removing assignment to hitNumber does not allow to be highlighted in green
	public void setHighlight(int lineNumber,int rangeIndex) {
		tableViewer.refresh(
//		hitNumber = lineNumber;
		hitIndex = rangeIndex; // have to specify the rangeIndex so that EditLabelProvider knows how to highlight in green
		FindChangePrimaryCommandWizardPage.ACTIVE_RECORD_NUMBER = lineNumber;
		tableViewer.getTable().setSelection(hitNumber - 1); // table is zero-index based
		tableViewer.getTable().setTopIndex(hitNumber - 1); // table is zero-index based
	}
	
	// removed refresh.. doesn't work it eigther
	public void setHighlight(int lineNumber,int rangeIndex) {
//		tableViewer.refresh();
		hitNumber = lineNumber;
		hitIndex = rangeIndex; // have to specify the rangeIndex so that EditLabelProvider knows how to highlight in green
		FindChangePrimaryCommandWizardPage.ACTIVE_RECORD_NUMBER = lineNumber;
		tableViewer.getTable().setSelection(hitNumber - 1); // table is zero-index based
		tableViewer.getTable().setTopIndex(hitNumber - 1); // table is zero-index based
	}
	// remove setSelection - doesn't work either. 
	public void setHighlight(int lineNumber,int rangeIndex) {
//		tableViewer.refresh();
		hitNumber = lineNumber;
		hitIndex = rangeIndex; // have to specify the rangeIndex so that EditLabelProvider knows how to highlight in green
		FindChangePrimaryCommandWizardPage.ACTIVE_RECORD_NUMBER = lineNumber;
//		tableViewer.getTable().setSelection(hitNumber - 1); // table is zero-index based
		tableViewer.getTable().setTopIndex(hitNumber - 1); // table is zero-index based
	}
	
	// when i do this, it doesn't set the top index properly
	public void setHighlight(int lineNumber,int rangeIndex) {
		tableViewer.refresh();
		tableViewer.getTable().setTopIndex(hitNumber - 1); // table is zero-index based
		FindChangePrimaryCommandWizardPage.ACTIVE_RECORD_NUMBER = lineNumber;
		tableViewer.getTable().setSelection(hitNumber - 1); // table is zero-index based
		hitNumber = lineNumber;
		hitIndex = rangeIndex; // have to specify the rangeIndex so that EditLabelProvider knows how to highlight in green
	}
	
	// green not being highlighted
	public void setHighlight(int lineNumber,int rangeIndex) {
		tableViewer.refresh();
		tableViewer.getTable().setTopIndex(hitNumber - 1); // table is zero-index based
		FindChangePrimaryCommandWizardPage.ACTIVE_RECORD_NUMBER = lineNumber;
		tableViewer.getTable().setSelection(hitNumber - 1); // table is zero-index based
		hitNumber = lineNumber;
		hitIndex = rangeIndex; // have to specify the rangeIndex so that EditLabelProvider knows how to highlight in green
