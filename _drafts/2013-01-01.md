* Company Holiday

Personal
--------

* Uneventful.  In New Years eve, we exploded some fireworks.  On New Year's Day, didn't do that much at all. I slept and ate mostly.  But my wife said that most shops are closed and there is really nothing to do anyway during that day except relax.  Maybe, I should have watched "The Hobbit".

* Still looking at issue 1425.  Got to get this resolved this week.
* Also spoke to Ken, have to continue with my install process
* Status Meeting
    - install guide will be revised.
    - need to work on the installation guide.

Personal
--------

* Had a conversation with Karen Stern and she provided a list of places under $50000.
Will meet up with her again to discuss the properties.  I was thinking that this might offend Russ, but I don't think so.  Russ is a property manager and when we are looking for properties, he hasn't offered one up lately.
* This will be part of the plan to increase our income every year.
* Right now, we have 8 rental units and would like that to be 20 units.
* 20 units * 700 = 14000 * 12 = 168K / year
* 168K / year on rental units is enough to retire on.
* This year though, I still need to be thrifty.  I don't need to buy a lot of stuff.  In fact, I don't need anything this year.  Try not to buy anything expensive this year for myself.  Try to save as much as possible.
* I will be earning 100K / year.  Therese plans to earn 60K / year.  Plus the apartments and we are looking good.
* Don't need a big house for the kids.  If they want to study, just bring them to the library to work on their homework.  So after school, go to the library for a few hours and let them do their homework.  When they come home from school, provide them some snacks (healthy snacks like fruits and vegetables) and let them finish their homework.  Only allow them to watch their shows on weekend mornings.
* I will have all my kids learn the piano.  Should I force it on them or start it when they show interest.  There is no quitting piano.
* As for my health.  I have to reduce my rice/carbo consumption as well as my sweets.  How do I make that happen.  Change having to change my lifestyle....
* Need to talk to Therese about plans when going back to Long Island.  Do we meet with both her friends.
* No Xmas gift for Therese and I.  We both love each other and there is really nothing she or I really want or need.  I get what I want.
* We have a get-together dinner tonight.  It will be fun.
	- Uncle Cecil gave out a $100 check.  That was nice of them.
	- He said that Florida was the best place to live b/c of the sunshine

* When I do a find all, the occurrence is set to "ALL".  But it only returns 50 records.
	- Results go from record number 8521 to 8570

* After speaking with Ravish.  Our GUI should be as dumb as possible.  No need to collect the findList.
	- You want the mainframe to be as dumb as possible.

GUI - find occurrence FIRST, NEXT, LAST, FIND !
to reproduce 
open file ad1qa.fmmvs90.test.fruz in edit mode
1) do a FIND dialog string=Ness , occurrence = next(=default), location=Prefix , and press FINDALL button 3 matches found positioning? highlight ?

EC: This works.  In the dialog box, it says "3 Matches Found".  It also went to line number 8522 and highlighted the two instances of "Ness".

2) do a FIND dialog string=Ness, occurrence=first , location=prefix and press FIND button line 8522 blue background and first string Ness in green 

EC: This works.  In only highlights the first instance of Ness in line number 8522.

3) do a FIND dialog string=Ness, occurrence=next , location=prefix and press FIND button same line 8522 blue background and first string Ness in green (NOK !)

EC: This works.  It highlights the second instance of Ness in line 8522.

4) do a FIND dialog string=Ness, occurrence=next , location=prefix and press FIND button same line 8522 blue background and nextt string Ness in green 

EC: This should go to the next instance of "Ness"  It should go to a different line number.

5) do a FIND dialog string=Ness, occurrence=next , location=prefix and press FIND button
same line 8522 blue background andt string Ness in green(=NOK!)
6) do a FIND dialog string=Ness, occurrence=last , location=prefix and press FIND button
same line 8640  blue background and  string Ness in green (= OK)
7) do a FIND dialog string=Ness, occurrence=previous , location=prefix and press FIND button

It might be because it's a bug b/c of the same line issue.

* Need to start preparing for the trip back home.
* We will only be visiting Rebekah and their family.
* Grandma is walking with Bucky and Amelia.  I wonder how they will do. 
	- Hope it works out and Amelia doesn't complain.
* No need to get a new car.  Just repair and clean my current car as much as possible.
	- My Honda-CRV is still a nice car to drive.
	- Get the Oddysey detailed when we are back home.
* The next to save up for is a 4-plex.  9 * 700 = 6300 / month.. That would be great.

--------

* Need to charge all personal electronic devices for the long road trip.
* Fill up gas tank or maybe do it in GA.  Much cheaper there.
* Buy some junk food for the road trip ahead.
* Do we need to buy some more water for the trip?

2013-01-05
==========

Personal
--------

* Planning to leave Jacksonville, FL at 2am.
* Our stop will be at Tysons Corner, VA.  Taking I-95N, it will take at 10 hours.
* We will meetup with Therese's friends to show off the new babies.
* We should be arriving Sunday night at Long Island.
* When I get home, I'm going to clean the CR-V trunk.  Just gotta respect the ride.
