[Dropwizard](http://dropwizard.codahale.com/) is one of [Thoughtworks adopted framework](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/#/languages-and-frameworks/519)
so I thought I would check it out.  I posted my sample at [Github](https://github.com/caritos/DropWizardDemo).

It's an interesting product and can probably replace our Tomcat Servlet implementation.
