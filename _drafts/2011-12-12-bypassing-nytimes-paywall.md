================

Have you experienced nytimes.com paywall:

![nytimes.com paywall](http://caritos.github.com/images/nytimes_paywall.png)

To get around this issue, I go to incognito mode in chrome to continue reading the article.

* [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org)
* [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org)
* [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com)

I ended up choosing Paper.js because:

* Android doesn't support SVG, that removed Raphael out of the picture.
* Paper.js has better support for object level events than processing.js.

I good summary of the pros and cons of these 3 libraries can be found [here](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/22/web-drawing-throwdown-paper-processing-raphael/)
