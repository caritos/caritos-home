## Tasks
- create a new flutter 3 project and document it.
- Need to drop Amelia and Claire off for band and chorus.  I will have to bring Nina as well since I don't want her alone in the house.  

## Notes
- Sophia was grumpy this morning.  Before going to school, I made her put the plates away from the dishwasher.
