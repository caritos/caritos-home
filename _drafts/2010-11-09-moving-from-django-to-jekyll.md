* [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/ "Github Pages") is a feature of [GitHub](http://github.com/ "Github") that allows you to publish content to the web by simply pushing content to one of your GitHub hosted repository. 
* [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/ "Jekyll") is a simple, blog aware static site generator.  

With these tools, I am able to create a blog that fits my workflow.  I wanted my site geared towards the way I work.  That is mostly being in front of editor and pushing code thru a version control system.  When I found out about Jekyll, I thought it was the perfect fit.  Once I finish writing a post, all I have to do is push the post back to github for it to be generated.
