# Improving Typing Speed with TypeRacer

Just discovered the site [typeracer](https://play.typeracer.com/).  It's a site where you can compete with your friends and improve your typing speed.  I just tested myself for the first time and I got 72 wpm.  Need to improve that since I thought I was much faster than that.  Anyways, cool site.  I'll be visiting it often.
