## [tennis](https://github.com/caritos/busy-bee)

A website I made for my tennis friends to keep track of our tennis matches.  The site is built using the [ktor](https://ktor.io) framework using the [kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) programming language.  I'm using [Freemarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/) as my templating engine.  The site uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to make it look appealing.  I'm using [Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) for my database.

## [school](https://github.com/caritos/frog-flip)

I'm developing a [student information system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_information_system) to help administrators and teachers manage the students at [Holy Trinity Academy of Calamba](https://www.holytrinityacademyofcalamba.com/).
