* Pawel Brzeminski
* how to find profitable business ideas
    - select target market (not the idea)
        * create a list of industries
            - referenceusa.com
            - criteria
                * at least 2000-5000
                * affinity
                * ideal markets => niche / obscure
                * contactable
                    - email
                    - phone
                    - linkedin
    - contact the market
        * create a list of businesses
        * send emails / schedule phone calls
        * ask questions to find pain points (and shut up, let them talk)
        * wave the magic wand question (magical question)
    - select the problem
        * list all problems
        * focus on the most painful, least complex and with the highest value for the customer
    - pre-sell your solution
        * schedule call
        * review pain
        * present solution* make an offer (ask to buy)
        * rinse & repeat ( minimum 3-5 people )
        * start developing the product
        * why is pre-selling useful?    
            - problem -> solution -> build -> market -> sell
            - building and marketing can take months/years
            - pre-selling can be done in one 30min conversation
        * use conferences to turbocharge this process
            - incredible pace of learning
            - repiad feedback
            - early adopters
            - follow up after the conference
            - smaller is better 
        * what worked / didn't work for me
            - assocaition chairman
            - get specific
            - get personal
            - calls recording
            - stay in touch
        * my stats
            - 1 market => sent 174 emails over 10 weeks
            - 174 emails => connected iwth 32 peopel
            - 32 people => 52 calls
            - 52 calls => 8 problems
            - 1 problem => 7 pre-sales / $4200
    - develop the smallest solution
