# Hardware

As someone who likes to stay mobile, I’ve set up a portable workstation to ensure productivity wherever I go. Here's a rundown of my current setup:

- M1 MacBook Air: This lightweight and powerful machine is perfect for my needs. The M1 chip offers excellent performance, and the portability is unbeatable.
- Laptop Stand: To improve ergonomics, I use a stand that raises the screen height. This, combined with a book for extra elevation, helps reduce neck and shoulder strain—a crucial adjustment as I’ve noticed more discomfort with prolonged computer use.
- External Keyboard: I’m currently using an old Apple keyboard from my previous iMac. Although functional, it’s showing its age; the "esc" key no longer works, so I’ve remapped it to "F1". An upgrade might be in order soon.
- Bluetooth Mouse: My mouse is small and portable, featuring a scroll wheel for convenience. It’s nothing fancy but gets the job done.
- Bose Headphones: These headphones are essential for blocking out noise and helping me concentrate, especially in bustling environments.

# Software

As a software developer, I rely on various tools to streamline my workflow:

- IntelliJ IDEA: After experimenting with different IDEs and spending too much time customizing nvim, I’ve settled on IntelliJ IDEA. It’s robust and user-friendly, though I’m still learning all the shortcuts. I plan to stick with it for the long term.
- GitHub Desktop: For Git management, I prefer GitHub Desktop over the terminal. It’s more intuitive for me and simplifies version control tasks.
- Firefox: I switched to Firefox as my default browser after encountering ad-blocking issues with Google Chrome. Firefox has been reliable and aligns better with my needs.
- Obsidian: For note-taking, Obsidian is my go-to app. I appreciate its ability to link notes and visualize connections. Plus, it’s free to use across both my phone and computer.
- Fantastical: This app helps me keep my calendar and to-do list organized. Its integration features make managing tasks and schedules much easier.
- YouTube's LOFI Girl: Background music is vital for maintaining focus, and I often listen to YouTube's LOFI girl while working.
- Raycast Pomodoro Timer: To enhance productivity, I’m experimenting with the Pomodoro timer in Raycast, breaking work into intervals to maintain concentration and efficiency.
