# Review of the REI Co-op Trail 40 Pack

Guess what I found in the bargain bin of REI's website.  I purchased the REI Co-op Trail 40 Pack for a subotal of $29.39 at a 75% discount.
I'm going to be using this backpack as an everyday carry rather than hiking through the woods.  I thought this bag might be too big for an everyday carry but it looks just right.  One thing to love about this backpack is that you can open up the zippers fully to have full access to the bag.
