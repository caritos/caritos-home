# Upgrading Ram for Thinkpad X220

I'm running multiple tabs on Firefox in Window 1. I'm running a PDF Viewer and Terminal in Window 2.  I noticed a slowness when switching tabs in Firefox as well as switching between Window 1 and Window 2.

I think it's alright that it works in the terminal but when I have a X-Windows running and just running a few apps, the slowness is noticeable.
That why I thought it would bea good time to buy some ram.

I searcht he Web and found at the the type of Ram that the X220 could use were called DDR Sodimms.
I saw it on ebay for 49 but they were shipping from China.  I saw it on NewEgg for 55 and shipping withing the United States.  Total cost including shipping and taxes were 60$.   That was already 2/3 of the price of the Thinkpad itself.  It's kind of pricy but I felt that in order to make the Thinkpad more usable I had to do it.

Still waiting for it so I'll take some pictures when I do install it.
