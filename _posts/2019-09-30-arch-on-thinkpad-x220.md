# Installed Linux Arch on Thinkpad X220

![linux-arch-screenshot](/assets/linux-arch-screenshot.png)

One of the reasons I bought a low cost notebook was to play around with Linux.  I've been watching Luke Smith from YouTube as he talks about his Linux setup and it's quite impressive.  In his YouTube videos he talkes about just buying an old Thinkpad as they are still quite usable.

So I finally did it.  I bought a sub $100 Thinkpad on Ebay, installed Arch on it and here I am.  I still have a long way sot go to gain mastery of this environment but hopefully in due time, it will become second nature for me getting around this enironment.
