I was listening to a [Lex Fridman interview with Pietel Levels](https://lexfridman.com/pieter-levels-transcript/) and one of the tip Pieter does it send error messages to his telegram account.

I was able to implement this on my ktor app pretty easily. Moving forward, I'll ping myself regarding any errors in the websites.
