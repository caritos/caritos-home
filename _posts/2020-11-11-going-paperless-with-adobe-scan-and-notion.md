# Going Paperless with Adobe Scan and Notion

## Notion and Adobe Scan

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is a note taking app that I use as my 2nd brain.  Things that I don't want to keep in my brain, I store in Notion so I can retrieve it later. I had used Evernote before but Notion is more effective when note taking.

[Adobe Scan](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-scan-digital-pdf-scanner/id1199564834)  was a free app I found on the App Store that scanned documents.

## How I'm using Adobe Scan and Notion

After scanning a document in Adobe Scan, I then share a copy of that image to my Notion app.  When I'm ready to review it, it's already on my desktop Notion app where I can organize it more effectively.
